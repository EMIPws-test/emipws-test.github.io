The 6th International Workshop on Eye Movements in Programming was held on **Monday, May 27, 2019** in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It is co-located with [ICSE 2019](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2019/).

The study of eye gaze data has great potential for research in computer programming, computing education, and software engineering practice. The Sixth International Workshop on Eye Movements in Programming (EMIP 2019) will focus on advancing the methodological, theoretical, and applied aspects of eye movements in programming. The goal of the workshop is to advance the methodology of using eye gaze tracking for programming, both theoretically and in applications. What can gaze behavior tell us about cognitive processes during programming? How can eye tracking help us to understand the role of human factors in software engineering?
The workshop is open to all ICSE attendees who are interested in eye tracking and its related data, platforms, analyses, and applications. We welcome research and industry participants, especially those who have opportunities to put eye tracking applications into practice. We include demo sessions to provide hands-on experiences for those unfamiliar with the practical use of eye trackers.
