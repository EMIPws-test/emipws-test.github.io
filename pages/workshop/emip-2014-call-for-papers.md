The second international workshop on Eye Movements in Programming Education focuses on the development of novice programmers. Reading occurs in debugging, maintenance and the learning of programming languages. It provides the essential basis for comprehension. By analyzing behavioral data such as gaze during code reading processes, we explore this essential part of programming. To participate send a mail to [teresa.busjahn@fu-berlin.de](teresa.busjahn@fu-berlin.de). Note that it is possible to participate independent of attending WiPSCE. Prior to the workshop, participants will get three data sets showing a novice’s gaze during code reading tasks at the beginning, middle and end of an introductory Java course.

Participants will delve into the data in order to identify and reflect on stages of novice development. A short individual position paper of the results is required (max. 2-3 pages). A technical workshop report including the position papers will be published at FU Berlin. During the workshop session in Berlin, we will work on how novice code reading skills develop and how this progress can be linked to observable gaze data. Afterwards, participants jointly prepare a publication describing the results.
