# Session 1 (09:00am – 10:30am)
- 9:00am: Introduction
- 9:05am: **Keynote**: Eye tracking: Past Achievements and Future Directions — Dror Feitelson – Hebrew University, Israel ([Slides](http://emipws.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-emip-eye-comp.pdf))
> Reading and comprehending code is different from reading regular text. And eye tracking, which measures where we look, for how long, and how much mental effort we exert, can provide crucial data. The talk will survey some achievements and suggest future direction.
