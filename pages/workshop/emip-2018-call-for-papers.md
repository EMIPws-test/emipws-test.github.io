Eye Movements in Programming 2018, emipws.org
International Workshop
co-located at ETRA 2018, the 10th ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research & Applications, Warsaw, Poland, June 17, 2018Call for PapersGaze data has a high potential in research on computer programming, in computing education and practice. The fifth international workshop on Eye Movements in Programming (EMIP’2018) will focus on advancing the methodological, theoretical and applied aspects of eye-movements in programming. Previously we focused on understanding expert and novice source code reading behaviors, on models to interpret data, and we launched the first distributed data collection in this discipline. By analyzing the pre-shared datasets and discussion of bottom-up data-to-models approaches, the workshop produced new methods, tools and understanding of source code reading gaze patterns.
We invite contributions focusing on gaze behaviour in comprehension, debugging, and other tasks of programming, including social aspects, vision and educational perspectives. These may include, but are not limited to, affective computing in programming, vision based models, readability, and new theories of program comprehension. Contributions are expected to present implications to industrial programming practice or programming education.

Participants submit a paper (4 pages + 2 pages references) through the ETRA PCS submission site [https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login] All submissions will be reviewed by the program committee.

Important dates:
– deadline for papers: April 15, 2018

Paper submission (4 pages + 2 pages references ACM two column format):

Format of the submission: SIGGRAPH FORMAT. Please retrieve templates here: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template]. Word authors, **\*please\*** ensure you read the appropriate manual as ACM formatting is very complex, and ensure you use the “sigconf” template style. Consider using Overleaf as an easier alternative to Word formatting (see template page for details). ALL AUTHORS must use the “author year” citation and reference format. Please refer to the siggraph conference template as a guide [https://www.siggraph.org//sites/default/files/template-sigconf.pdf].
Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format to EMIP-track through the ETRA submission system: [https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?society=etra]
