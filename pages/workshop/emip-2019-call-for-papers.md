# Workshop Overview
Studying eye gaze data has great potential for research in computer programming, computing education, and software engineering practice. The Sixth International Workshop on Eye Movements in Programming (EMIP 2019) will focus on advancing the methodological, theoretical, and applied aspects of eye movements in programming. In previous editions of this workshop, we focused on understanding expert and novice source code reading behaviors and building models to interpret data, and we launched the first distributed data collection in this discipline. By analyzing the pre-shared datasets and discussing bottom-up data-to-models approaches, the workshop produced new methods, tools, and understanding of source code reading gaze patterns.

The goal of the workshop is to advance the methodology of using eye gaze tracking for programming, both theoretically and in applications. What can gaze behavior tell us about cognitive processes during programming? How can eye tracking help us to understand the role of human factors in software engineering?

# Topics of Interest
We invite contributions analyzing gaze behavior of activities related to programming, such as code reading and debugging, social aspects, vision, and educational perspectives. These may include, but are not limited to, the role of emotions in programming, vision-based models, readability, and new theories of program comprehension. Contributions are expected to present implications to industrial programming practice or programming education. Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Practical methods of using eye tracking
- Identification and analysis of appropriate data abstractions
- Models of cognition about software development
- Effects of text-based, graphical, or diagram-based program representations
- Effects of syntax or language features, as well as programming paradigms
- Identification and analysis of behaviors and strategies of learners’ reading, writing, and debugging code, acquiring new domains and skills, longitudinal growth
- Challenges for learners or software engineers (e.g., obstacles to learning or accomplishing tasks)
- Applications for eye tracking, e.g., software engineering tasks, such as program comprehension, debugging, requirements traceability, change tracking
- Development and evaluation of tools and processes for working with eye tracking
- Development and evaluation of visualizations for static and dynamic program execution
- Applications offering programming assistance or accessibility using eye tracking devices, data, and analyses
- Combinations of eye tracking with other sensing modalities, such as fMRI, EEG, or fNIRS
- Multi-person eye tracking, e.g., during pair programming or collaborative problem solving
- Eye gaze datasets and source code amenable to eye gaze studies
- Analyses of pre-existing eye gaze datasets
- Development of platforms, tools, and methods which enable reproducible experiments

# Submissions and Presentations
One half of the workshop will be devoted to presenting new research results. The other will focus on facilitating discussion, teaching practical skills, and growing the community. Note, we may not have room for every accepted paper to receive a talk slot. However, to enable all to share their research progress, we will hold a poster session for all workshop attendees. Furthermore, we will have a hands-on demo session, in which participants can use eye trackers, explore promising analytical pipelines, and see potential outcomes of eye tracking studies.

We invite three types of contributions: new research results (up to 8 pages), new ideas (4 pages), and demos (2 pages). Page limits include references. Submissions must be written in English and should be submitted through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=emip2019). Please follow the [IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html) (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTEX users must use ```\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}``` without including the ```compsoc``` or ```compsocconf``` option).

Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the program committee. All accepted papers will be published in a workshop proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries. The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available by IEEE. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2019. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to attend the workshop and present the paper in person.
