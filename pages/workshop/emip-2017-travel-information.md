# Suggested Hotels
[Hampton by Hilton Berlin City West](http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/berlin/hampton-by-hilton-berlin-city-west-TXLBCHX/index.html)
(It has a very good location within the city. Getting to the workshop takes about 30 minutes by public transport. Ask for a room to the back, so the window is not facing the train line.)

[Hotel Steglitz International](http://www.si-hotel.com/?lang=en)
(This one is closer to the workshop, but a bit farther away from the airport and sights).
